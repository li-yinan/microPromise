============

a microPromise for 3rd embed environment

welcome to microPromise
-----------------------

micro promise is a implementation of Promise, for 3rd part embed environment.

advantages:
-----------
less than 1k (795byte exactly) after gzip (version 1.0)

disadvantages:
--------------
Implement `when` `then` only, no more...
Maybe further time we can do more...
But the size is the highest priority thing.
Small is beautiful.


p.s. surround code with (function () { micro promise })();
